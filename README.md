# Belly-Button-Biodiversity

In this assignment, we built an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity DataSet. We used Plotly.js to build interactive charts for your dashboards.
We created a PIE chart that uses data from your samples route (`/samples/<sample>`) to display the top 10 samples We used `sample_values` as the values for the PIE chart.
We created a Bubble Chart that uses data from your samples route (`/samples/<sample>`) to display each sample.

We displayed the sample metadata from the route `/metadata/<sample>`. And We displayed each key/value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

## Step 2 - Heroku

We deployed the Flask app to Heroku.
